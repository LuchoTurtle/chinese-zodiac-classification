# Chinese Zodiac Classifier
This is perhaps my first ever repo regarding Deep Learning! Even though I did not submit this to the [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/elderyouth/chinese-zodiac-signs/kernels), I completed the challenge just to learn more about PyTorch and the Deep Learning workflow. This was, actually, a challenge from the Udacity Bertelsmann Deep Learning scholarship, created by Student Leaders. 

This repository has different classifiers based on three different models: [Inception V3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00567.pdf), [VGG19](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf) and [ResNet18](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf). Therefore, this repository is solely focused on transfer learning.

## Models
The following table showcases the differences in accuracy between the three models.

Model | Overall Accuracy     |
:-------------: | :-------------: |
Inception V3 | 90% | 
VGG19 | 89% |
ResNet18 | 90% |
